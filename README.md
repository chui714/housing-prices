# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository contains the code and resources for the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" data science project from Kaggle. The project is aimed at predicting house prices based on various features using advanced regression techniques.

## Kaggle Competition Link

The original Kaggle competition link for the dataset and project details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sale prices of houses based on different features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc. The dataset provided by Kaggle contains both training and testing data, and we will use various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection techniques to build an effective predictive model.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific tasks or functions used in the project.
- `models/`: Saved models or model artifacts generated during training.
- `results/`: Results, predictions, and evaluation metrics.
- `README.md`: The main documentation file providing an overview of the project.
